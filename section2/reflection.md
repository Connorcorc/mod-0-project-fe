## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

I quite enjoyed the concept of the SMART learning. It breaks down the work process into smaller steps to think about. I also was intrigued by how determined you have to be to truly learn and thrive in your career.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I currently believe I can improve with effort and practice. One thing I am working on in the field of NOT using a growth mindset, is being defensive towards feedback. This is something I have worked on for years and am finally starting to grasp it.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

It pushed me to acquire some knowledge on my own, and made the learning process that much more exciting!

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement is if, then, else. If I want to work out, then I need to go to the gym! Facebook most likely uses if userName type of statements!

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

You use if..else. The program will go through the first condition. If it's false, if will go to the next condition until one is met or the final condition is declared. If it's true, it runs the codeblock.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

You can use the logical operators &&(and) and ||(or).

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
