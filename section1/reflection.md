## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I tend to self-sabotage. I usually think people are going to judge me if I ask a question and the
answer is super simple. This is something I need to work on for this program.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

String = When you want to print a string of characters.
Variable = This is where you assign data types
Boolean = This is a true or false statement
Number = This data type is for numbers and math.


3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

console.log('Hello World!');

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

// (double slash) is for single line code. while /* */ is for multi-line comments. This is to explain to yourself and your fellow programmers what exactly the code is doing.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is where you store information!

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

Facebook most likely uses variable such as firstName, lastName, dateOfBirth, cityOfBirth, etc.
They'd all store strings!

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is a way to put together strings and data types into one output.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

On reddit, they say "Welcome Name!". I'm sure this code goes something along the lines of ("Welcome  " + userName + "!");

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

None I can think of!
