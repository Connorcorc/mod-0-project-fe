## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?

It felt great. I'm learning more of the correct wording to look things up! I definitely thing being pushed to do some research on my own helps me learn much quicker.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

Spotify is a great example. For playlists or liked songs, it's a great way to organize them all into a list.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

Array methods are great ways to modify, delete, or add data from or to your array.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

A loop iterates over as many times as you tell it, or until it returns false and stops the loop. This is great for sorting through conditions. It's also good with arrays to see if any of the items in the array meet the criteria, and if not, what to do with them.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

A loops does the same thing over and over until it stop getting the answer it wants.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

I think i'm grasping the concept quite well. More questions will arise with more study time!
